   <h2 id="about">ABOUT ME</a></h2>
 <br>
 
      <p>My name is <b>Erez Haguy</b>&#127773;,
      <br>I am 44 years old and I am a father of three Children.
      <br>I am living in Ashkelon, Israel.
      <br>I have been running a supermarket store for more than 20 years.
      <br>For the past 14 years I have been working at "Shufersal" as a store manger.
      <br>Ever since I was a little child I have had an affection for computers, I even studied "MCSA" in the early 2000s.
    
      <br>In my spare time I like to play online games on my Gaming Console, watch Netflix and go to the park with my children.
      <br>Something interstung about me, during my military service I was bitten by a viper snake.
      <br>As a result, I was hospitalized for a week in intensive care.
      <br>After I finished my military service, I adopted a Pyton snake as a pet. &#128013;
      <br>I got the snake as a birthday present from my brother.
